# Responsive Design

The assignment  was to clone [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/), a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.
  
This project was inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) online learning curriculum.
